# HORIZON

Welcome to the **ISDC Hackathon!** ðŸš€

This hackathon is not just a competitionâ€”itâ€™s an opportunity to learn, collaborate, and innovate while working on real-world projects. Our goal is to identify talented peers who will join ISDC and contribute to exciting consultancy projects, helping them earn while they learn and build industry-ready skills.

Through this event, you'll get a hands-on experience of how hackathons work. While this is an online hackathon, the collaboration, problem-solving, and teamwork you develop here will prepare you for bigger challenges, including our upcoming offline hackathon!

So gear up, bring your ideas to life, and show us what youâ€™ve got! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
